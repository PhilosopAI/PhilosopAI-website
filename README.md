# 🧠 PhilosopAI

> “He who thinks deeply sees clearly.” — *PhilosopAI*

*A thoughtful AI designed to help you reflect, question, and grow.*

PhilosopAI is an open-source initiative to build a conversational AI that inspires deep thought, enhances writing, and acts as a philosophical guide for creators and thinkers. This repository hosts the **Landing Page** — a clean HTML + Tailwind + JS website to introduce PhilosopAI to the world.
